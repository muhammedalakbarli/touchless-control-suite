# Touchless Control Suite 🎯  
Hand & Face Tracking Mouse Controller (MediaPipe + OpenCV)

Touchless Control Suite is a real-time computer vision project that lets you control your mouse using:
- ✋ Hand gestures (move, click, scroll, drag)
- 🙂 Face tracking (move with nose/head, click with facial gestures)

Built for accessibility, touchless UI experiments, and portfolio-grade CV projects.
